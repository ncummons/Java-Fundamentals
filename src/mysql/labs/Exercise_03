*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

            SELECT * FROM flights
            WHERE flights.flight_date
            LIKE "2018-12-25";

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day

            SELECT * FROM flights
            WHERE flights.flight_date
            LIKE "2018-12-25"
            AND flights.destination_airport_id = 5
            AND flights.origin_airport_id = 2;

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today

            SELECT passengers.first_name, passengers.last_name, flights.flight_num
            FROM passengers
                JOIN tickets
                ON passengers.passenger_num = tickets.passenger_num
                JOIN tickets_flights
                ON tickets.ticket_num = tickets_flights.ticket_num
                JOIN flights
                ON tickets_flights.flight_num = flights.flight_num
            WHERE flights.flight_date
            LIKE "2018-12-25"
            AND flights.destination_airport_id = 5
            AND flights.origin_airport_id = 2;

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

            SELECT passengers.first_name, passengers.last_name, flights.*
            FROM passengers
                JOIN tickets
                ON passengers.passenger_num = tickets.passenger_num
                JOIN tickets_flights
                ON tickets.ticket_num = tickets_flights.ticket_num
                JOIN flights
                ON tickets_flights.flight_num = flights.flight_num
            WHERE flights.flight_num = 1
            AND passengers.passenger_num = 1;

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday

            SELECT passengers.*
            FROM passengers
                JOIN tickets
                ON passengers.passenger_num = tickets.passenger_num
                JOIN tickets_flights
                ON tickets.ticket_num = tickets_flights.ticket_num
                JOIN flights
                ON tickets_flights.flight_num = flights.flight_num
            WHERE flights.flight_num = 3
            AND passengers.passenger_num = 5
            AND flights.flight_date LIKE "2021-07-08";

*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year

            SELECT COUNT(flight_num)
            FROM flights
            WHERE (flights.origin_airport_id = 5 AND flights.destination_airport_id = 1)
            OR (flights.origin_airport_id = 1 AND flights.destination_airport_id = 5)
            AND (flights.flight_date BETWEEN '2021-07-09' AND '2021-07-16');

*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year

            SELECT COUNT(passengers.passenger_num)
            FROM passengers
            	JOIN tickets
            	ON passengers.passenger_num = tickets.passenger_num
            	JOIN tickets_flights
            	ON tickets.ticket_num = tickets_flights.ticket_num
            	JOIN flights
            	ON tickets_flights.flight_num = flights.flight_num
            WHERE (flights.origin_airport_id = 5 AND flights.destination_airport_id = 1)
            OR (flights.origin_airport_id = 1 AND flights.destination_airport_id = 5)
            AND (flights.flight_date BETWEEN '2021-07-09' AND '2021-07-16');

*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports

            INSERT INTO flights (flight_date, flight_time, pilot_num, airline_num, plane_num, destination_airport_id, origin_airport_id)
            VALUES ('2021-07-15', '12:00:00', 1, 2, 5, 3, 4);

*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights

            INSERT INTO tickets (ticket_num, passenger_num)
            VALUES (9, 9);

            INSERT INTO passengers (class, first_name, last_name, age, group_num, ticket_num)
            VALUES ("First", "Melody", "Homan", 27, 7, 9);

*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight

            UPDATE passengers
            SET class = "First"
            WHERE passenger_num = 1;

*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
