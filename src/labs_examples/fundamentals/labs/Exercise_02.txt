1) If you haven't already, please create a Github account if you have not already done so.

2) Once complete, practice the following on your own machine and paste the commands you run for each step below.

Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    Nicholass-MBP-2:CodingNomads ncummons$ mkdir git_practice
    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder.
            Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git init
            Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ncummons/Documents/CodingNomads/git_practice/.git/
        b. Make new file
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ touch Practice_file.txt
        c. Add file
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git add Practice_file.txt
        d. Commit file
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git commit -m "Creating a practice file"
        [master (root-commit) 7ed9c0d] Creating a practice file
         1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
         create mode 100644 Practice_file.txt
        c. On Github, create new git_practice repository
        d. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>
            git remote add practice https://github.com/ncummons/git_practice.git
        d. Push commit file to Github
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git commit -m "Practicing"
        [master 81132e7] Practicing
         1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git push

        e. Practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:
            i.   Create or modify file
            ii.  Add file(s)
            iii. Commit file(s)
            iv.  Push file(s) to Github repository

Adding a remote
    1. Create new personal repository on Github named "git_practice_2".
    2. On local machine, add the new remote address to the same git repo you were working with in the previous section above
        (directions are provided on Github with new repo is created)
        Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git remote add practice2 https://github.com/ncummons/git_practice_2.git
    3. Push local git repository to your Github using the new remote.
    Nicholass-MBP-2:git_practice ncummons$ git push practice2 master
